# Add Comment Bot

[![Build Status][travis-status]][travis-url]

A [Probot](https://probot.github.io) bot to add/remove a comment to issues and pull requests when a label is present/removed.

## Setup

Add a `.github/comment.yml` file to your repository and then run the bot against it.

If the config is empty or doesn't exist, the bot will not run.

```yml
# Example Config

# This config will look for any issues and pull requests that have been labeled with `needs-area`. A comment
# will be added to the issue or pull request and will be removed once the `needs-area` label is removed.
issues:
  - label: needs-area
    comment: |
      Please add an `area:<team>` label to this issue.
pulls:
  - label: needs-area
    comment: |
      Please add an `area:<team>` label to this pull request.
```

### Backwards compatibility
Previous version of the bot will still work with current version, as the schema for the configuration file does not change the structure. So it's possible to upgrade and keep old configuration:

```yaml
# The old format matches the new one, using a different name
comments:
  - label: needs-area
    comment: |
      Please add an `area:<team>` label to this issue.
```
